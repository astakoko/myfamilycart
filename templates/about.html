            MyFamilyCart came to life as we / our tiny family needed a common
            place to save our shopping lists. The App lets you create different
            shopping carts (lists) which you can add and remove items.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will also see a Topp50 item page where you can see what items you buy
            the most. Further statistics might be introduced down the road should the need
            arise. If you have ideas feel free to look under the Open Source section
            and add a github issue!
